# Get Edge
## Code Challenge 37

### Challenge Description
    - Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaskan Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so,
      how much would this trip cost in total?
      
    - Write a function that takes in a graph and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built in methods,
      return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
    
    
    - Structure and Testing
       - Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
