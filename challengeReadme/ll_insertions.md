
# Reverse an Array
I paired with Nicole Dana on this challenge in class.

    This Code Challenge requires that user is able to find specific nodes within the LinkedList and then either insert new
    Nodes or insert new values into those nodes.


### Challenge
    - .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
    - .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
    - .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
